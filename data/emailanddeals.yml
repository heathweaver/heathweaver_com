    title: Personal Project to better understand AI
    start_date: 2024-09-01
    end_date: 2025-01-01
    location: Brussels
    responsibilities:
      - Designed and implemented the entire architecture for emailsanddeals.com, including backend, frontend, and deployment.
      - Developed 12 microservices in Python for email processing, including fetching, parsing, sanitizing links, and integrating affiliate links.
      - Integrated AI systems (e.g., OpenAI) for email content review and deal extraction, later transitioning to Python-based LLM and OCR tools for improved efficiency.
      - Built a responsive frontend using Deno Fresh (TypeScript) and ensured seamless user interaction with thumbnails, text, and a search engine.
      - Managed database design and optimization using MariaDB, transitioning from Appwrite to improve page load times from 18 seconds to under 1 second.
      - Implemented Redis for efficient queuing and task management after refactoring from a database table-based queue system.
      - Automated the generation of blog posts and tweets for every processed email, ensuring full system automation.
      - Handled deployment, version control, and staging workflows using Git, including pull requests and staging branch management.
    achievements:
      - "Processed 11,500 emails over 2.5 months, achieving a processing rate of 1 email every 5 seconds."
      - "Improved deal extraction accuracy from 80% to 95% through iterative AI model refinements and Python-based tooling."
      - "Improved deal extraction accuracy from 80% to 95% through iterative AI model refinements and Python-based tooling."
      - "Reduced page load times from 18 seconds to under 1 second by refactoring the backend and migrating to MariaDB."
      - "Fully automated the system, enabling end-to-end processing of emails, including affiliate link integration, thumbnail generation, and content publishing."
      - "Subscribed to 450+ stores for deal aggregation, demonstrating scalability and integration capabilities."
      - "Successfully implemented Redis for task queuing, improving system reliability and performance."
      - "Gained hands-on experience with AI integration, Redis, Deno Fresh, and advanced Python development."
